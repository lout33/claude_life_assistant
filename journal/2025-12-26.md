## Morning
**MIT:** Build the bicycle for the mind

## Notes

**Pattern surfaced:** Projects don't fail — they fade. Luis said: *'What usually kills my projects is just forgetting about them, not tracking them, not taking them seriously.'*

**What's different this time:** This one is for sharing, not just for himself. *'It could be something that I want to share... just share it with everybody.'*

**Next step:** Make a video about this agent and configuration.

## Evening

**Shipped:** Video published + social post. Said he'd do it, did it same day.

**Win:** First public share of the bicycle for the mind. Project is now real.
