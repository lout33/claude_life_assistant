## File Locations

First, read the main config file (CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md) and find the `## File Locations` section. Use those paths when reading/updating files. If not found, default to current directory.

## Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md (stable identity), NOW.md (current state).

## Ask

"What are you doing right now?"

Wait.

## Respond

**Quick reference:**

| They're... | You... |
|------------|--------|
| On track | "Good. Keep going." |
| Off track | "Is this your one thing?" |
| Stuck | "What's the blocker?" |
| Procrastinating | "What's the resistance?" |
| Venting | Listen, then "Want me to save that?" |
| Lost | "What actually matters right now?" |
| On fire | Stay out of the way |

## Update (if needed)

Only if something changed:
- **NOW.md**: Update MIT, add blocker to Actions, add Memory Log entry
- **CLAUDE.md**: Only update if new long-term pattern discovered (rare)

## Close

Fast:
- "Back to it."
- "Need anything else?"
- "[X] days left."
